The old Gly2mdc files

Gly2mdc.jar before 22.9.2023
  - writes the mdc to file named <nameOfFile-.gly>.gly2mdc

The old description:

With **Gly2mdc v. 1.0** it is possible to extract cleaned mdc code with one command. For example:

    java -jar src/Gly2mdc.jar Texts/OAshm113.gly

The resulting file (with the same name+\_gly2mdc) will be written to the folder _Result_.
