A few example texts with which the tool can be tested:

- OAshm113.gly is a binary file produced with JSesh
- OAshm113_glyToString shows the content of the gly-file when parsed to string
- OAshm113_mdc.txt has the Manuel de Codage encoded text when copied from JSesh
- OAshm113_gly2mdc.txt is a the same text produced with Gly2mdc
